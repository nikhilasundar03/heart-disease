# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of getting heart disease based on 13 parameters. These parameters include:

- age
- sex
- chest pain type (4 values)
- resting blood pressure
- serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- maximum heart rate achieved
- exercise-induced angina
- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes related to heart health and is widely used in the study of heart disease and related risk factors. It has been sourced from Kaggle.

## Methodology
The model development involves the use of machine learning algorithms, likely including classification techniques, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the provided parameters. The data has been preprocessed and analyzed to ensure the quality and accuracy of the model's predictions.

## Results
The heart disease prediction model provides insights into the probability of an individual having heart disease based on the provided input parameters. The accuracy of the model has been evaluated, and the results demonstrate its potential usefulness in identifying potential risk factors for heart disease and assisting in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Usage
Feel free to use the provided code for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on the 13 parameters mentioned above. You can modify the code for experimentation and further analysis. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed before running the code.

## Future Work
This project serves as an initial exploration of heart disease prediction based on the given parameters. Future work could involve the incorporation of additional relevant features, the exploration of different machine learning algorithms, and the development of a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to utilize the model effectively.
